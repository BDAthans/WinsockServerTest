	The getaddrinfo function is used to determine the values in the sockaddr structure:
		- AF_INET is used to specify the IPv4 address family.
		- SOCK_STREAM is used to specify a stream socket.
		- IPPROTO_TCP is used to specify the TCP protocol.
		- AI_PASSIVE flag indicates the caller intends to use the returned socket address structure in a call to the bind function. 
		  When the AI_PASSIVE flag is set and nodename parameter to the getaddrinfo function is a NULL pointer, the IP address 
		  portion of the socket address structure is set to INADDR_ANY for IPv4 addresses or IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for IPv6 addresses.
		- 27015 is the port number associated with the server that the client will connect to.

	The addrinfo structure is used by the getaddrinfo function.
	In this example, a TCP stream socket for IPv4 was requested with an address family of IPv4, a socket type
	of SOCK_STREAM and a protocol of IPPROTO_TCP. So an IPv4 address is requested for the ListenSocket.
	If the server application wants to listen on IPv6, then the address family needs to be
	set to AF_INET6 in the hints parameter. If a server wants to listen on both IPv6 and IPv4, 
	two listen sockets must be created, one for IPv6 and one for IPv4. These two sockets must 
	be handled separately by the application.
	Windows Vista and later offer the ability to create a single IPv6 socket that is put in 
	dual stack mode to listen on both IPv6 and IPv4.
